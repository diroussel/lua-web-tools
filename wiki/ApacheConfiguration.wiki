#summary Explains the configuration of mod_lwt in the Apache HTTP Server

= Introduction =

mod_lwt provides an Apache handler and associated configuration directives. 

= Configuring the Handler =

The handler provided by mod_lwt is called `lwt`. This handler handles requests to the HTTP server by invoking a Lua script. The handler is typically configured by having the following directive either in the global server configuration or in a virtual host configuration:

{{{
AddHandler lwt .lua
}}}

This directive associates the `lwt` handler with the `.lua` file extension. Requests for files ending in `.lua` are passed to the `lwt` handler.

= Configuration Directives =

mod_lwt provides several configuration directives. These directives can be used both in the server configuration and in the per-directory configuration. Use of these directives in a `.htaccess` file requires `AllowOverride Options`.

|| *Directive* || *Type* || *Default* || *Description* ||
|| `LuaPath` || `string` || Lua default || The `LuaPath` directive configures the Lua path. See the [http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.3 Lua documentation] for information on the workings of the Lua path. ||
|| `LuaCPath` || `string` || Lua default || Like `LuaPath`, but configures the Lua C path instead. || 
|| `LuaErrorOutput` || `On` or `Off` || `Off` || Determines whether a diagnostic information formatted in HTML is written to the HTTP response when a Lua syntax error or runtime error is encountered while loading or running the Lua script. ||
