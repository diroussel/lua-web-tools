#summary Explains the request processing flow of mod_lwt.

= Overview =

The mod_lwt handler handles requests to the HTTP server by invoking a Lua script. More formally, the handler performs the following steps:

  # Test if request is supposed to be handled by `lwt`. If not, decline to handle the request.
  # Test if the Lua script file exists. If not, return a HTTP 404 (Not Found) status code.
  # Default the response content type to `text/html`.
  # Create a new Lua state.
  # Open the standard Lua libraries in the Lua state.
  # Open the `httpd.core` library in the Lua state.
  # Load the Lua script to run, reporting syntax errors in HTML. Return a HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status code if a syntax error, out of memory error or IO errors in encountered.
  # Set the `package.path` and `package.cpath` variables according to the configuration directives applicable to the script.
  # Invoke the script, passing the _request_ and _args_ values as detailed below, reporting any runtime errors in HTML. Return a HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status code if a runtime error, out of memory error or error handler error is encountered.
  # If the script returns no value or `nil`, assume the request was handled successfully; if the script returns a number between 100 and 599, return it as the HTTP status code; return a HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status code for all other return values.

Note that a new Lua state is created for each request and that mod_lwt is thsu completely stateless. This is a deliberate design decision. If you need to maintain state between requests, use tools such as HTTP arguments and cookies, databases and caches in a combination that is suitable to your requirements.

= Example =

This example shows a simple Lua script for mod_lwt.

{{{
require "httpd" -- Import the httpd library

request, args = ... -- Get the request and args values passed to the script

name = args.name or "Unknown" -- Process arguments

httpd.set_content_type("text/plain") -- Set content type
httpd.write("Hello, " .. name .. "\r\n")
httpd.write("Welcome to " .. request.hostname .. "\r\n")
}}}

For the sake of simplicity, this example does not use the mod_lwt template engine.

= The `request` Value =

The `request` value is passed as the first argument to a Lua script. It is a table-like userdata value and contains information about the current request. The following table shows the fields of the `request` value:

|| *Field* || *Description *||
|| `protocol` || The protocol used in the request, typically `http` or `https`. ||
|| `hostname` || The hostname used in the request, e.g. `www.mydomain.com`. ||
|| `path` || ||
|| `path_info` || Any path information following the requested Lua script, including the beginning slash, e.g. `/additonal/path/segments`. If there is no additional path information, the fields contains the empty string. ||
|| `args` || The GET arguments passed along with the request. ||
|| `method` || The request method, e.g. `GET` or `POST`. ||
|| `headers_in` || A table-like userdata value containing the request input headers. Use the `httpd.pairs` function to iterate over this table. ||
|| `headers_out` || A table-like userdata value containing the request output headers. Use the `httpd.pairs` function to iterate over this table. These headers are only transmitted for successful request. For example, a `Location` header used in a redirect should _not_ go here as these headers would not be transmitted if the script returns a 3xx redirect HTTP status code. ||
|| `err_headers_out` || A table-like userdata value containing the request output headers. Use the `httpd.pairs` function to iterate over this table. These headers are transmitted regardless of the outcome of the request. For example, a `Location` header used in a redirect should go here. || 
|| `filename` || The filename of the requested Lua script. ||
|| `filedir` || The directory where the requested Lua script resides. ||
|| `user` || The authenticated user, or `nil` if none. ||
|| `auth_type` || The type of authentication provided by the user, or `nil` if none. ||
|| `local_ip` || The local IP address (responding HTTP server) ||
|| `remote_ip` || The remote IP address (requesting HTTP client) ||

Note that the request value is a userdata value that cannot be iterated with the Lua `pairs` or the mod_lwt `httpd.pairs` functions.

= The `args` Value =

The `args` value is passed as the second argument to a Lua script. It is a table-like userdata value and contains the arguments passed with the current request. More specifically, mod_lwt decodes the following types of arguments:

  * `GET` arguments from the URL
  * `POST` arguments using a content type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (regular form post)
  * `POST` arguments using a content type of `multipart/form-data` (typically used for file uploads)

For other content types, no processing is done by mod_lwt, and the Lua script can process the request body directly.

The fields of the `args` value can be accessed by name (e.g. `args.field`) or by iterating over the arguments using the `httpd.pairs` function. The latter method must be used if there are multiple values with the same name in the arguments.

For uploaded files, the `args` value contains the temporary file name of the uploaded file. Note that these temporary files are deleted at the end of the request.
